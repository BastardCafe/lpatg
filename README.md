The Bastard Café's "Let's Play All The Games" project

This project lets logged in users register when they have played
which games.
It all started when O suggested we play all the games at the Bastard
Café in Copenhagen. At first game plays were tracked in a spreadsheet,
but hopefully this is easier to work with, especially from mobile
devices.
